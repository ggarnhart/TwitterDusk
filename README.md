# TwitterDusk
A Chrome Extension that changes Twitter's theme to match Twitter's night mode.

Images and scripts used in the extension and the extension's welcome page are stored in their respective folders.

The "night.css" file is the injected stylesheet used to change Twitter's theme. Since Twitter's website supports the use of custom colors (in terms of certain buttons and profiles), an "execute.js" file is stored in the scripts directory. Certain items are then injected further, using two "important" css tags."'"'
